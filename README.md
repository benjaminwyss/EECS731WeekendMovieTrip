# EECS 731 Project 3: Weekend Movie Trip
Submission by Benjamin Wyss

## Project Overview

Examining MovieLens movie data to build a clustering model which can recommend movies similar to other movies

### Data Sets Used

MovieLens Small Datasets - Movies, Ratings, and Tags - Taken from: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ on 9/23/20

The small data sets were selected because they will reduce overall model complexity while still providing a sufficiently large number of samples (9742 movie samples)

### Results
